ESPHome components to monitor Jikong Battery Management Systems (JK-BMS) via UART-TTL, BLE, and RS-485.

## Via RS-485 - GOOD for monitoring and control SWITCHES and NUMBERS (the ESP acts as MASTER)

**NEW:** monitor your new JK-PBx BMSs via internal RS485 network using 1 only ESP. [Click here](https://github.com/txubelaxu/esphome-jk-bms/blob/main/components/jk_rs485_bms/README.md) for more info. Home Assistant dashboards inside as well.

**Last Change:** Added RCV Time and RFV Time as Read & Write
**Last Change:** control your BMSs settings (Numbers): cell_smart_sleep_voltage, cell_undervoltage_protection, cell_undervoltage_protection_recovery, cell_overvoltage_protection, cell_overvoltage_protection_recovery, cell_balancing_trigger_voltage, cell_soc100_voltage, cell_soc0_voltage, cell_request_charge_voltage, cell_request_float_voltage, cell_power_off_voltage, cell_balancing_starting_voltage, max_charging_current, charging_overcurrent_protection_delay, charging_overcurrent_protection_recovery_delay, max_discharging_current, discharging_overcurrent_protection_delay, discharging_overcurrent_protection_recovery_delay, short_circuit_protection_delay, short_circuit_protection_recovery_delay, max_balancing_current, charging_overtemperature_protection, charging_overtemperature_protection_recovery, discharging_overtemperature_protection, discharging_overtemperature_protection_recovery, charging_lowtemperature_protection, charging_lowtemperature_protection_recovery, 
mos_overtemperature_protection, mos_overtemperature_protection_recovery, cell_count_settings, battery_capacity_total_settings, precharging_time_from_discharge

Broadcast is possible with those settings too.
Updated: 0master_2slave example & 0master_7slave example

Last: control your BMSs settings (Switches) "balancing", "charging" and "discharging" switches. New "broadcast mode" to easy switch on/off every BMS in the network.

Last: new parameters added and new dashboards
+ New Dashboards (summary, cells, settings, protection) available [here](https://github.com/txubelaxu/esphome-jk-bms/tree/main/components/jk_rs485_bms/home_assistant_dashboards)
+ Multiple alarm signals: BATTempSensor1Absent, BATTempSensor2Absent, BATTempSensor3Absent, BATTempSensor4Absent, BATTempSensor5Absent, BatOVP, BatUVP, BatteryOverTemp, CPUAuxCommuErr, CellOVP, CellQuantity, CellUVP, ChOCP, ChOTP, ChSCP, ChUTP, ChargeMOS, CurSensorErr, DchOCP, DchOTP, DchSCP, DischargeMOS, DischargeOnFailed, GPSDisconneted, MOSTempSensorAbsent, ModifyPWDinTime, MosOTP, PLCModuleAnomaly, TemperatureSensorAnomaly, WireRes (thanks to [@jblance and @jrventer](https://github.com/jblance/mpp-solar/issues/460)
+ difference between: "switch status" and "real working status". Useful for balancing, for example: balancer could be ON, but balancing can be on or off, depending on conditions...

## Via Bluetooth (BLE) or UART (best for controlling)

Last: new parameters added and new dashboards
+ New information about device: vendorid, hardware_version, software_version, device_name, device_password
  So, if you lose your password of your jk bms you can recover using this.
